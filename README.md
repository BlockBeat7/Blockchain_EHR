# KunyiEHR v0.0.1 (Sepolia Testnet)

## What is KunyiEHR

Kunyiehr aims to implement a blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system by issuing patients blockchain-based medical identities using the NTG-213 chip. This involves assigning patients a blockchain public address and providing them with the corresponding private key stored on NFC medical cards. Facial recognition is integrated using face_recognition.js to bind facial biometric data to the NFC card, ensuring uniqueness in biometric identification. Patients' outpatient records are uploaded onto the EVM blockchain using a Faucet mechanism, generating unique hash values for each record. Additionally, patients' diagnostic records are encapsulated as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and released to their public addresses, with visibility restricted exclusively to the patient.
